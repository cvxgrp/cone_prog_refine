# `cpsr`: Cone Program Solution Refinement

`cpsr` is a [Python](https://www.python.org) library 
for the iterative improvement, or refinement,
of a primal-dual solution,
or a certificate of unboundedness or infeasibility,
of a [cone program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_optimization). 
It operates by differentiating the conic optimality conditions (also knonw as KKT),
and so it can also be used for calculus with conic programs.

### Refinement

Given an approximate solution (or certificate), 
meaning one for which the optimality 
conditions don't hold exactly, 
`cpsr` produces a new solution for which 
the norm of the violations of the primal and dual constraints, 
and the duality gap, is smaller. 

It does so by locally linearizing
the operator ùí© (z) ‚àà ùó•^(n), 
the concatenation of the violations of the 
primal and dual constraints, and the duality gap,
for any approximate primal-dual solution (or certificate) z ‚àà ùó•^(n).
So, ùí© (z) = 0 if and only if z in an exact primal-dual solution
or certificate, meaning one for which the optimality conditions
are satisfied within machine precision. 
It uses [LSQR](http://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsqr/),
an iterative linear system solver, to approximately solve the linearized system.

`cpsr` is a matrix-free solver, meaning that it does not store or
invert the derivative matrix of ùí© (z). This allows it to scale
to very large problems. Essentially, if you are able to load the problem
data in memory, then `cpsr` can solve it, with O(n) memory requirement.

It currently supports cone programs that are
either 
[linear programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming),
[second-order cone programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_cone_programming), 
[exponential programs](https://yalmip.github.io/tutorial/exponentialcone/), 
[semidefinite programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming),
and any combination. 

### Installation
To install, execute in a terminal:

```
pip install cpsr
```

`cpsr` depends on [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org) for vector arithmetics, 
[`scipy`](https://www.scipy.org) for sparse linear algebra,
and [`numba`](https://numba.pydata.org) for just-in-time code compilation.
It currently runs on a single thread, on CPU. I plan to support 
multi-threading and GPUs, 
and rewrite the algorithmic part of the code in C. I also plan to
release interfaces to other scientific programming languages.

A detailed description of the algorithm used is provided
in [the accompanying paper](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/cone_prog_refine.html).

### `cvxpy` interface

`cpsr` can be used in combination with [`cvxpy`](https://www.cvxpy.org),
via the `cpsr.cvxpy_solve` method. An example follows.

```python
import numpy as np
import cvxpy as cp
import cpsr

n = 5
np.random.seed(1)
X = cp.Variable((n,n))

problem = cp.Problem(objective = cp.Minimize(cp.norm(X - np.random.randn(n, n))), 
                     constraints = [X @ np.random.randn(n) == np.random.randn(n)])

cpsr.cvxpy_solve(problem, presolve = True, verbose=False)
print('constraint violation norm of solution refined from SCS: %.2e' % 
      np.linalg.norm(problem.constraints[0].violation()))

cpsr.cvxpy_solve(problem, verbose=False)
print('violation norm after running CPSR again: %.2e' % 
      np.linalg.norm(problem.constraints[0].violation()))
```

It has the following output.

```
constraint violation norm of solution refined from SCS: 1.48e-11
violation norm after running CPSR again: 5.21e-16
```
